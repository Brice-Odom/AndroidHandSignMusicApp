# Audio Resources Setup

For the hand sign detection app to play different notes when hand signs are detected, you need to create the following audio files and place them in the `res/raw` directory:

1. **note_c.mp3** - C note sound file
2. **note_d.mp3** - D note sound file  
3. **note_e.mp3** - E note sound file
4. **note_f.mp3** - F note sound file
5. **note_g.mp3** - G note sound file
6. **note_a.mp3** - A note sound file
7. **note_b.mp3** - B note sound file

## Creating the raw directory

1. In Android Studio, right-click on the `res` folder in your project
2. Select New > Android Resource Directory
3. Select "raw" as the Resource type
4. Click OK

## Adding sound files

1. Download or create MP3 files for each of the notes (C, D, E, F, G)
2. Right-click on the newly created `raw` folder
3. Select New > File
4. Choose your sound files from your computer
